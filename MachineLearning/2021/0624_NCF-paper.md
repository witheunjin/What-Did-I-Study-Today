3.2 Generalized Matrix Factorization(GMF)
 Due to the one-hot encoding of user(item) ID of the input layer, the obtained embedding vector can be seen as the latent vector of user(item).

### One-hot Encoding

### Latent Vector
*The latent space is simply a representation of compressed data in which similar data points are closer together in space.*
